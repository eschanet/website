# [eschanet.com](http://eschanet.com) 

My personal website built using javascript with React, Express, React-Router, Github actions and a bunch of other fancy stuff. 

## Set up

1. Download the repository and install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    git clone git://github.com/eschanet/website.git
    cd website
    npm install
    ```

2. Next, create an `.env` file:

    ```bash
    cp sample.env .env
    ```

    Change values as appropriate.

3. Build the react application and serve it including hot module reloading:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
