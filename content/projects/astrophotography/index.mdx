I love taking photographs of our night sky just like the one shown here (the Andromeda galaxy). Some of my photographs have been featured in articles and printed journals. My deep sky and planetary pictures are taken with a Canon DSLR and a 6 inch newtonian telescope on a custom-built guided mount.
