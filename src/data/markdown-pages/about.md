### Intro

I am a particle physicist at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich, working at the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. In my research, I apply data science techniques, machine learning algorithms and advanced statistical methods to petabyte-scale data taken at CERN. 
<br><br>
I have in-depth knowledge of advanced statistics and mathematics, and strong expertise in computer science. My core competencies include predictive modelling using machine learning and stochastic methods, exploratory data analysis, implementing distributed computing workflows, quantitative problem solving in cross-functional teams, and data visualization. I also have significant experience working in large, international collaborations and coordinating projects from initiation to completion. 
<br><br>
I am a co-founder of [Weabe](https://weabe.lu) where I worked as a software engineer and consultant. I am particularly interested in applying data science techniques to problems in industry as well as academia, but always open to new adventures. If you would like to arrange a meeting, please get in touch.

### I like
- Science in general, but particle physics especially so.
- Conveying complex, quantitative information to diverse audiences. Researchers should do a better job of explaining what it is exactly they are doing with public money.
- Data Science and gaining insights from large, complex datasets.
- Travelling around Europe (and beyond) in my self-converted camper van.
- Spending time with my dog and significant other (disclaimer: not in that order).
- Hiking in the mountains. The higher, the better. My personal best so far: 4900m.
- Nepal. I seriously love it! The people, the culture and the mountains. All of it is simply breathtaking.

### I dream of

- Enabling a brighter future by building products that matter.
- Particle physics experiments finding new physics, in some form or another. I sincerely hope that new physics is somewhere close and that we indeed *live in interesting times*.
- Seeing more of the many wonderful places on our planet.
