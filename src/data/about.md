#### Intro

I am a research fellow and Ph.D. candidate in particle physics at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich. I work at the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. At ATLAS, I am searching for supersymmetry, an  exciting extension to the current Standard Model of particle physics. I am also interested in high-performance computing and involved in ATLAS grid computing developments.

I am a co-founder of [Weabe](https://weabe.lu), a luxembourgish lifestyle platform, where I worked as a software engineer and consultant. I am also the co-founder of [Codelight](https://codelight.lu), a software development and consulting joint venture. I am available to consult on interesting projects. I am particularly interested in science, computing and data analysis, but always open to new adventures. If you would like to arrange a meeting, please get in touch.

#### I like
- Science in general, but particle physics especially so.
- science communication and outreach. Researchers should do a better job of explaining what it is exactly they are doing with public money.
- Data, and gaining insights from large, complex datasets. There is so much interesting stuff in these.
- Travelling around Europe (and beyond) in my self-converted camper van.
- Spending time with my dog and significant other (disclaimer: not in that order).
- Hiking in the mountains. The higher, the better. My personal best so far: 4900m.
- Nepal. I seriously love it! The people, the culture and the mountains. All of it is simply breathtaking.

#### I dream of

- Enabling a brighter future by building products that matter.
- Particle physics experiments finding new physics, in some form or another. I sincerely hope that new physics is somewhere close and that we indeed *live in interesting times*.
- Seeing more of the many wonderful places on our planet.
